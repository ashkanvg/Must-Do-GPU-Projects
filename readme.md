# CSEE217 GPU Projects

This repository contains four different GPU programming projects completed as part of the **CSEE217 course project** at UCR. Each project focuses on a different aspect of GPU computing, utilizing CUDA for implementation.

## Projects

1. **Matrix Addition**
   - This project demonstrates how to perform matrix addition using CUDA, showcasing parallel computing techniques for handling large matrices efficiently.

2. **Reduction**
   - In this project, a reduction operation is implemented on the GPU to efficiently compute the sum of a large array of numbers using parallelism.

3. **Matrix Multiplication**
   - This project implements matrix multiplication using CUDA, providing a high-performance solution to multiplying two large matrices in parallel.

4. **Histogram**
   - This project illustrates how to compute a histogram on the GPU, distributing the computation across multiple threads to speed up the process.
